Generally, vitamin D intake is low {$<$} or = 2-3 microg/d in Europe. Casual exposure to sunlight is thought to provide most of the vitamin D requirement of the human population. However, skin synthesis of vitamin D may not compensate for the low nutritional intake in Europe, even in countries with high supplies from food fortification and supplements. For assessment of vitamin D nutritional status the concentration of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) in serum is considered to be an accurate integrative measure reflecting an individual's dietary intake and cutaneous production. A substantial percentage of the elderly and adolescents in Europe have a low concentration of 25(OH)D; in the elderly this percentage ranges from approximately 10 in the Nordic countries to approximately 40 in France. Low vitamin D status seems to be aggravated by disease and immobility, and by a low frequency of supplement use.},

The prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency is 40--45\% in the general German population. An additional 15--30\% are vitamin D deficient. Vitamin D can prevent falls and osteoporotic fractures in older people. There is also accumulating evidence that vitamin D may prevent excess mortality and may probably prevent some chronic diseases that occur in early life such as type 1 diabetes and multiple sclerosis. Adherence to present sun safety policy (avoidance of the sun between 11 am and 3 pm) and dietary recommendations (5--10 {$\mu$}g daily for adults) would, however, definitively lead to vitamin D deficiency. The estimated cost saving effect of improving vitamin D status in Germany might be up to 37.5 billion \texteuro{} annually. It should be the goal of nutrition and medical societies to erase vitamin D deficiency in Germany within the next 5--10 years. To achieve this goal, the daily production of at least 25 {$\mu$}g of vitamin D in the skin or an equivalent oral intake should be guaranteed.},

Methods: Eighty-four students were recruited into the study of which 77 remained at the study's completion. Women were assigned to one of two subgroups, according to their 25-hydroxy vitamin D test level [25(OH)D] in which 60 women had low 25(OH)D levels (LD {$<$} 30 ng/mL) and 17 had normal levels (ND {$>$} 30 ng/mL {$\leq$} 80 ng/mL). Results: In the LD group, 40\% of participants reported having long cycles, 27\% were classified as having oligomenorrhoea, and 13\% as having amenorrhoea. In the ND group, only 12\% reported menstrual cycle disorders, 6\% had oligomenorrhoea, and 6\% had amenorrhoea. Women who did not meet the recommended level of 30 ng/mL of 25(OH)D had almost five times the odds of having menstrual cycle disorders as women who were above the recommended vitamin D level. Conclusion: A relationship was demonstrated between the frequency of menstrual disorders and low levels of vitamin D. Supplementation is necessary in women with low levels of vitamin D in order to compensate for this deficiency and to assess its effect in regulating menstrual disorders.},

  abstract = {Calcitriol (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3), the hormonally active form of vitamin D, inhibits the growth of many malignant cells including breast cancer (BCa) cells. The mechanisms of calcitriol anticancer actions include cell cycle arrest, stimulation of apoptosis and inhibition of invasion, metastasis and angiogenesis. In addition we have discovered new pathways of calcitriol action that are especially relevant in inhibiting the growth of estrogen receptor positive (ER+) BCa cells. Calcitriol suppresses COX-2 expression and increases that of 15-PGDH thereby reducing the levels of inflammatory prostaglandins (PGs). Our in vitro and in vivo studies show that calcitriol decreases the expression of aromatase, the enzyme that catalyzes estrogen synthesis selectively in BCa cells and in the mammary adipose tissue surrounding BCa, by a direct repression of aromatase transcription via promoter II as well as an indirect effect due to the reduction in the levels of PGs, which are major stimulator of aromatase transcription through promoter II. Calcitriol down-regulates the expression of ER{$\alpha$} and thereby attenuates estrogen signaling in BCa cells including the proliferative stimulus provided by estrogens. Thus the inhibition of estrogen synthesis and signaling by calcitriol and its anti-inflammatory actions will play an important role in inhibiting ER+BCa. We hypothesize that dietary vitamin D would exhibit similar anticancer activity due to the presence of the enzyme 25-hydroxyvitamin d-1{$\alpha$}-hydroxylase (CYP27B1) in breast cells ensuring conversion of circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D to calcitriol locally within the breast micro-environment where it can act in a paracrine manner to inhibit BCa growth. Cell culture and in vivo data in mice strongly suggest that calcitriol and dietary vitamin D would play a beneficial role in the prevention and/or treatment of ER+BCa in women.},

  abstract = {There has been renewed interest in vitamin D since numerous recent studies have suggested that besides its well-established roles in bone metabolism and immunity, vitamin D status is inversely associated with the incidence of several diseases, e.g., cancers, cardio-vascular diseases, and neurodegenerative diseases. Surprisingly, there is very little data on factors that affect absorption of this fat-soluble vitamin, although it is acknowledged that dietary vitamin D could help to fight against the subdeficient vitamin D status that is common in several populations. This review describes the state of the art concerning the fate of vitamin D in the human upper gastrointestinal tract and on the factors assumed to affect its absorption efficiency. The main conclusions are: (i) ergocalciferol (vitamin D2), the form mostly used in supplements and fortified foods, is apparently absorbed with similar efficiency to cholecalciferol (vitamin D3, the main dietary form), (ii) 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD), the metabolite produced in the liver, and which can be found in foods, is better absorbed than the nonhydroxy vitamin D forms cholecalciferol and ergocalciferol, (iii) the amount of fat with which vitamin D is ingested does not seem to significantly modify the bioavailability of vitamin D3, (iv) the food matrix has apparently little effect on vitamin D bioavailability, (v) sucrose polyesters (Olestra) and tetrahydrolipstatin (orlistat) probably diminish vitamin D absorption, and (vi) there is apparently no effect of aging on vitamin D absorption efficiency. We also find that there is insufficient, or even no data on the following factors suspected of affecting vitamin D bioavailability: (i) effect of type and amount of dietary fiber, (ii) effect of vitamin D status, and (iii) effect of genetic variation in proteins involved in its intestinal absorption. In conclusion, further studies are needed to improve our knowledge of factors affecting vitamin D absorption efficiency. Clinical studies with labeled vitamin D, e.g., deuterated or (13)C, are needed to accurately and definitively assess the effect of various factors on its bioavailability.},

Objective We aimed to determine whether vitamin D or n-3 FAs supplementation reduce leukocyte telomere length (LTL) attrition over time by leveraging the VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL (VITAL) trial. Methods VITAL is a large, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled tr ial with a 2 x 2 factorial design of vitamin D3 (2,000 IU/day) and marine n-3 FAs (1 g/day) supplements for 5 years among a representative sample of 25,871 US females {$\geq$}55 and males {$\geq$}50 years of age. The VITAL Telomere study (NCT04386577) included 1054 participants who were evaluated in person at the Harvard Clinical and Translational Science Center. LTL was determined by the Absolute Human Telomere Length Quantification quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) method at baseline, Year 2, and Year 4. The pre-specified primary outcome measures were changes in LTL between baseline, Year 2 and Year 4. Analyses of intervention effect used mixed-effects linear regression models. Results LTL was measured in a total of 2,571 samples from the 1031 participants at baseline, year 2, and year 4. Compared to placebo, vitamin D3 supplementation significantly decreased LTL attrition by 0.14 kilo base pairs (kb) (95\%CI: 0.007, 0.27) over 4 years (p = 0.039). Overall trend analysis showed that the vitamin D3 supplementation group had LTLs that were about 0.035 kb higher per year of follow-up compared to placebo group (95\%CI: 0.002, 0.07, p=0.037). Marine n-3 FAs supplementation had no significant effect on LTL at either year 2 or year 4. Conclusion 4-years of supplementation with 2000 IU/day vitamin D3 reduced telomere attrition by 140 bp, suggesting that vitamin D3 daily supplementation with or without n-3 FAs might have a role in counteracting telomere erosion or cell senescence.},

One of the possible mechanisms in the pathophysiology of these mood disorders has been reported as oxidative stress and inflammation. In the light of this information, it is important to determine the relationship between antioxidant nutrients (such as vitamin D) and these diseases. There are points where the brain regions involved in the pathophysiology of depression and anxiety and vitamin D metabolism intersect. Recent Findings Low vitamin D levels are associated with increased symptoms of depression and anxiety. For this reason, vitamin D screening should be performed in the prevention and treatment planning of these mood disorders. Summary Vitamin D, which has antioxidant properties and activity in brain tissue, is important for mood disorders preventions or treatments but serum levels must be followed.},

Methods We included 1048 pregnant women who underwent prenatal exam with known serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 [25(OH)D3] levels and delivery at the Mackay Memorial Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan during 2015--2018. A daily dose 2000 IU of vitamin D was given, starting at 12--16 weeks of pregnancy, to reach the level of 20~ng/mL, and then a maintenance dose of 800 IU/day was given. The other 3654 women without vitamin D supplementation delivered in 2018 served as control group. Pregnancy outcomes were recorded for analysis. Results Over 80\% of the 1048 pregnant women were vitamin D deficiency. There was an inverse correlation between serum vitamin D levels and maternal body mass index (p~=~0.0366). We compared 375 women with serum vitamin D levels increased above 30~ng/mL after supplementation with control group. The rates of preterm birth, low birth weight, and postpartum hemorrhage between these 2 groups were 6.67\% vs. 11.19\% (p~=~0.007), 6.40\% vs. 10.0\% (p~=~0.025), and 1.33\% vs. 3.20\% (p~=~0.04), respectively. Conclusion Vitamin D deficiency is very prevalent in pregnant women, especially those with high BMI, in Taiwan. It can be corrected by adequate vitamin D supplementation, which may decrease the risk of pregnancy complications and bring benefits to the fetus.},

The data were analyzed by SPSS, ver. 16, and Chi-square tests, Fisher's exact test, paired-sample t-tests, and Pearson's correlation were used, wherever appropriate. The significance level was set at P {$<$} 0.05. Results Forty children completed the study; their mean age was 11.5 \textpm{} 1.175 years. The mean serum levels of both HDL-C and vitamin D showed a significant rise following the treatment in the study group (P = 0.007 and P {$<$} 0.001, respectively), whereas both variables decreased slightly in the control group (P = 0.27). There was no statistically significant difference in the mean serum levels of HDL-C and vitamin D between the two groups after the intervention (P = 0.11 and P = 0.20, respectively).

Healthy participants aged 18--45 years with body mass index (BMI) 18--30 without anemia or vitD deficiency were randomized to receive 20,000 international units (IU) vitD3 as single dose gummies or tablets with serial samples obtained to measure plasma vitD3 at baseline, 3, 6, 10, 24, and 48 h followed by a 2-week washout period. The same participants then crossed over to receive 20,000 IU vitD3 in the form not previously given, with sampling at the same time points. Deidentified blood samples were analyzed for vitD3 concentration by liquid chromatography (LC)-mass spectroscopy. In Study 1, results suggested bioavailability was greater with gummies compared with tablets, (effect size 1.08 at 24 h). In Study 2, the area under the concentration curve (AUC) was higher with gummies than tablets (gummy mean (95\% CI): 1474 ng{$\cdot$}/mL (1393--1555); tablet mean (95\% CI): 774 ng{$\cdot$}h/mL (693--855), p {$<$} 0.0001).

Vitamin K combined with vitamin D significantly increased the total bone mineral density (BMD): the pooled effect size was 0.316 [95\% CI (confidence interval), 0.031 to 0.601]. A significant decrease in undercarboxylated osteocalcin (-0.945, -1.113 to -0.778) can be observed with the combination of vitamin K and D. Simultaneously, subgroup analysis showed that K2 or vitamin K (not specified) supplement was less than 500 {$\mu$}g d-1, which when combined with vitamin D can significantly increase the total BMD compared with the control group fed a normal diet or the group with no treatment (0.479, 0.101 to 0.858 and 0.570, 0.196 to 0.945). CONCLUSIONS: The combination of vitamin K and D can significantly increase the total BMD and significantly decrease undercarboxylated osteocalcin, and a more favorable effect is expected when vitamin K2 is used.},

  abstract = {The aim of the present review is to discuss the roles of vitamin K (phylloquinone or menaquinones) and vitamin K-dependent proteins, and the combined action of the vitamins K and D, for the maintenance of bone health. The most relevant vitamin K-dependent proteins in this respect are osteocalcin and matrix Gla-protein (MGP). When carboxylated, these proteins appear to have the ability to chelate and import calcium from the blood to the bone, thereby reducing the risk of osteoporosis. Carboxylated osteocalcin appears to contribute directly to bone quality and strength. An adequate vitamin K status is required for the carboxylation of MGP and osteocalcin. In addition, vitamin K acts on bone metabolism by other mechanisms, such as menaquinone 4 acting as a ligand for the nuclear steroid and xenobiotic receptor (SXR). In this narrative review, we examine the evidence for increased bone mineralization through the dietary adequacy of vitamin K. Summarizing the evidence for a synergistic effect of vitamin K and vitamin D3, we find that an adequate supply of vitamin K, on top of an optimal vitamin D status, seems to add to the benefit of maintaining bone health. More research related to synergism and the possible mechanisms of vitamins D3 and K interaction in bone health is needed.},

  abstract = {Bones and teeth require nutrients to maintain optimal bone density. Environmental and habitual factors affect 20-40\% of bone density in addition to several nutrients such as vitamin D, especially for UV-B exposures which are essential for bone growth. Research on the impact of nutrition on bone strength has historically geared towards minerals, vitamin D, protein, and vitamin K. This study aimed to examine the role of vitamin D3, K2 supplements, and UV-B exposure on bone density, reflected by osteoblast cell formation. Pre and post-experimental laboratory studies were conducted to Wistar rats (Rattus norvegicus), which were divided into six groups. As much as 0.00045 mg/day of vitamin D and 0.81 mcg/day of K2 were administered. Besides, 290-315 nm of UV-B was administered 3 times a week for 25 minutes each. With the HE (hematoxylin eosin) test, the level of osteoblast cell was calculated after 21 days of treatment. Descriptive test results showed that the highest mean score was obtained from the vitamin D3+ K2 group. The ANOVA test result showed sig {$<$} 0.05 (p {$<$} 0.05), which indicated a significant difference. This research shows that the combination of vitamin D3 and K2 significantly increased osteoblast cell formation.},

  abstract = {Vitamin D is typically supplied in capsule form, both in trials and in clinical practice. However, little is known regarding the efficacy of vitamin D administered via oral sprays -- a method that primarily bypasses the gastrointestinal absorption route. This study aimed to compare the efficacy of vitamin D3 liquid capsules and oral spray solution in increasing wintertime total 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentrations. In this randomised, open-label, cross-over trial, healthy adults (n 22) received 3000 IU (75 \textmu g) vitamin D3 daily for 4 weeks in either capsule or oral spray form. Following a 10-week washout phase, participants received the opposite treatment for a final 4 weeks. Anthropometrics and fasted blood samples were obtained before and after supplementation, with samples analysed for total 25(OH)D, creatinine, intact parathyroid hormone and adjusted Ca concentrations. At baseline, vitamin D sufficiency (total 25(OH)D{$>$}50 nmol/l), insufficiency (31--49 nmol/l) and clinical deficiency ({$<$}30 nmol/l) were evident in 59, 23 and 18 \% of the participants, respectively. Overall, baseline total mean 25(OH)D concentration averaged 59{$\cdot$}76 (sd 29{$\cdot$}88) nmol/l, representing clinical sufficiency. ANCOVA revealed no significant difference in the mean and standard deviation change from baseline in total 25(OH)D concentrations between oral spray and capsule supplementation methods (26{$\cdot$}15 (sd 17{$\cdot$}85) v. 30{$\cdot$}38 (sd 17{$\cdot$}91) nmol/l, respectively; F=1{$\cdot$}044, adjusted r 2 0{$\cdot$}493, P=0{$\cdot$}313). Oral spray vitamin D3 is an equally effective alternative to capsule supplementation in healthy adults.},

The increase was greater (p {$<$} 0.05) for group A vs. B and C at Day 28, and vs. group B at Day 56. No significant difference among groups was observed for the other biomarkers. The 24,25OH2D remained stable over time. PTH decreased at Day 84 and FGF-23 increased at all time points. CTX-I and PINP increased slightly at Day 28. BALP decreased from Day 56 onward. Dkk-1 increased from Day 56 onward, while sclerostin did not show significant changes. In healthy individuals deficient in vitamin D, vitamin D supplementation exerted effects on multiple regulators of calcium, phosphate and bone metabolism, without marked differences using the three regimens.},

Methods: Single-center, open-label study on healthy subjects deficient in vitamin D (25 (OH)D {$<$} 20 ng/mL), randomized to receive cholecalciferol (DIBASE\textregistered, Abiogen Pharma, Italy) using three different schedules: Group A: 10,000 IU/day for eight weeks followed by 1000 IU/day for four weeks; Group B: 50,000 IU/week for 12 weeks, Group C: 100,000 IU/every other week for 12 weeks. Total cumulative doses were: 588,000 IU, 600,000 IU, 600,000 IU. The treatment regimens corresponded to the highest doses allowed for cholecalciferol for the correction of vitamin D deficiency in adults in Italy. Results: mean 25 (OH)D plasma levels significantly increased from baseline 13.5 \textpm{} 3.7 ng/mL to peak values of 81.0 \textpm{} 15.0 ng/mL in Group A, 63.6 \textpm{} 7.9 ng/mL in Group B and 59.4 \textpm{} 12 ng/mL in Group C. On day 28, all subjects showed 25 (OH)D levels {$\geq$}20 ng/mL and 93.1\% had 25 (OH)D levels {$\geq$}30 ng/mL. On day 56 and 84, all subjects had 25 (OH)D levels {$\geq$}30 ng/mL. No serious adverse events occurred during the study. Conclusions: normalization of 25 (OH)D serum levels was quickly attained with all the studied regimens. A more refracted schedule provided a higher systemic 25 (OH)D exposure.},

  abstract = {Background Improvements in antenatal vitamin D status may have maternal-infant health benefits. To inform the design of prenatal vitamin D3 trials, we conducted a pharmacokinetic study of single-dose vitamin D3 supplementation in women of reproductive age. Methods A single oral vitamin D3 dose (70,000 IU) was administered to 34 non-pregnant and 27 pregnant women (27 to 30 weeks gestation) enrolled in Dhaka, Bangladesh (23{$^\circ$}N). The primary pharmacokinetic outcome measure was the change in serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration over time, estimated using model-independent pharmacokinetic parameters. Results Baseline mean serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration was 54 nmol/L (95\% CI 47, 62) in non-pregnant participants and 39 nmol/L (95\% CI 34, 45) in pregnant women. Mean peak rise in serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration above baseline was similar in non-pregnant and pregnant women (28 nmol/L and 32 nmol/L, respectively). However, the rate of rise was slightly slower in pregnant women (i.e., lower 25-hydroxyvitamin D on day 2 and higher 25-hydroxyvitamin D on day 21 versus non-pregnant participants). Overall, average 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration was 19 nmol/L above baseline during the first month. Supplementation did not induce hypercalcemia, and there were no supplement-related adverse events. Conclusions The response to a single 70,000 IU dose of vitamin D3 was similar in pregnant and non-pregnant women in Dhaka and consistent with previous studies in non-pregnant adults. These preliminary data support the further investigation of antenatal vitamin D3 regimens involving doses of {$\leq$}70,000 IU in regions where maternal-infant vitamin D deficiency is common.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The effects of intermittent, high dose vitamin D treatment in older adults have not been documented. We conducted a meta-analysis to provide a quantitative assessment of the efficiency of intermittent, high dose vitamin D treatment on falls, fractures, and mortality among older adults. METHODS: Electronic databases were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on high dose, intermittent vitamin D supplementation among older adults. Two researchers independently screened the literature according to specified inclusive and exclusive criteria to extract the data. Meta-analysis was performed by using Review Manager 5.1.0 software. RESULTS: Nine trials were included in this meta-analysis. High dose, intermittent vitamin D therapy did not decrease all-cause mortality among older adults. The risk ratio (95\% CI) was 1.04 (0.91-1.17). No benefit was seen in fracture or fall prevention. The risk ratio for hip fractures (95\% CI) was 1.17 (0.97-1.41) while for non-vertebral fractures (95\% CI) it was 1.06 (0.91-1.22), and the risk ratio for falls (95\% CI) was 1.02 (0.96-1.08). Results remained robust after sensitivity analysis. CONCLUSION: Supplementation of intermittent, high dose vitamin D may not be effective in preventing overall mortality, fractures, or falls among older adults. The route of administration of vitamin D supplements may well change the physiological effects.},
